    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  15,616    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     45
      Number with same-slice register load:     45
      Number with same-slice carry load:         0
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,697 out of  15,822   10%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       404 out of  31,644    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        5,536
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         2,670 out of   5,536   48%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             115 out of 126,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
