  Number of Slice LUTs:                        216 out of  63,288    1%
    Number used as logic:                      216 out of  63,288    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             186
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                   30
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  15,616    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    90 out of  15,822    1%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of  31,644    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          222
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           161 out of     222   72%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   6 out of     222    2%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          55 out of     222   24%
    Number of unique control sets:              11
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              67 out of 126,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
